This is a successor to the original [ShinyTouch](http://code.google.com/p/shinytouch) project, which was written in Python. Like it, its goal is to create a method of using any regular monitor as a touchscreen simply by mounting a camera to the side. But, of course, it's all written in JavaScript!

The original code comes from one of antimater15's prototypes.

(I don't really know whether I should have made a Google Code project for this or not. Oh well.)

Oh, and my code sucks, don't blame any of it on him :)
